Basic RulebookIgnite Your Spark
In the Magic™ game, you are counted among the elite spellcasters of the Multiverse—the Planeswalkers. Some are
friends and others are foes. All wield terrifying magic and command armies of creatures torn from the endless planes of
reality. Your deck of cards represents all the weapons in your arsenal. It contains the spells you know and the creatures
you can summon to fight for you. Customize your own Magic deck, then challenge your friends to see whose spark
burns the brightest!
Trading card games like
the Magic: The Gathering®
game combine collectable
cards with a strategy game.
Start your collection with
an intro pack and begin
battling immediately with a
ready-to-play deck.
Once you’ve gotten a
handle on how to play,
customize your deck using
cards from booster packs,
starting with the ones
included in your intro pack.
You don’t know what cards you’ll get in a Magic
booster pack. You just start a collection and trade
with other players to get the cards you want. You
can find stores where Magic cards are sold at
Wizards.com/Locator.
The best part about a trading card game is
that it’s always changing. You design and build
your own unique decks, and each Magic game
you play is different. New Magic expansions
are released a few times a year, and
each new expansion
brings new ways to
stupefy and defeat your
opponents. Check out
MagicTheGathering.com

information, and news
about upcoming sets!

IntroductionSection 1:
The Basics
The Magic: The Gathering game is a strategy game played by two or more players, each of whom has a customized deck of Magic cards.
Over the course of the game, each player will take turns playing cards such as lands (which enable you to play your other cards), creatures,
sorceries, and other spells. Each player starts at 20 life. When you reduce your opponent to 0 life by attacking with creatures and playing
spells, you win!
Five Colors of Mana
Only one thing unites the infinite planes of the Multiverse: mana, the energy that fuels all magic. The five colors of mana are imbued
in the land itself, and a Planeswalker with a connection to a place can call upon its mana from across the sea of Æther between worlds.
Each color of mana fuels a different kind of powerful magic for you to command. For example, red spells have oR in their costs,
and tapping (turning) a Mountain gives you oR that you can spend to cast spells. It’s up to you whether to master one color or all five.
White
White is the color of law, order, and
structure. The sprawling Plains,
populated by soldiers, clerics, and
angels, provide white mana. You send
coordinated armies of smaller creatures
into battle to teach the enemy a lesson.
Green Blue
Green magic is about growth, life, and Blue magic relies on trickery and
brute force. The Forests overflow with manipulation. Islands provide blue
green mana, which represents the pulse mana, the color of the deep sea and
of nature. You empower your creatures the endless sky. You work behind the
with the predatory might of nature and scenes, controlling your environment
dominate through sheer size. completely before making a move.
Red Black
Red magic erupts with fire, frenzy, and Black magic is about death, disease, and
storms of rock and lava. Red mana comes power at any cost. Black mana comes
from Mountains and volcanoes. You from dank Swamps, where things fester
act quickly and recklessly, channeling and rot. You are as selfish and twisted as
your wild emotions to summon mighty the undead creatures and unspeakable
dragons or crush the ground your horrors you command.

card is the 154th of 249 cards in its set.
Card Types
Every Magic card has one or more types. A card’s type tells you when you can play the card and what
happens to the card after you do.
Sorcery
A sorcery represents a magical incantation. You can cast a sorcery only during a main phase of one of your
own turns. You can’t cast it when another spell is on the stack. (You’ll learn about phases and the stack in a
bit.) A sorcery has its effect—in other words, you follow the instructions on the card—then you put it into
your graveyard, which is the game term for your discard pile.

Instant
An instant is just like a sorcery, except you can cast it just about any time you want, even during your
opponent’s turn or in response to another spell. Like a sorcery, an instant has its effect, then you put it into
your graveyard.
Enchantment
An enchantment represents a stable magical manifestation. An enchantment is a permanent. This means two
things: you can cast one only at the time you could cast a sorcery, and after you cast one, you’ll put it on the
table in front of you, near your lands. (Most players keep their lands closer to them, then put their other
cards closer to the middle of the table.) The card is now on the battlefield. A card on the battlefield is called a
permanent because it sticks around permanently (well, unless something destroys it).
Some enchantments are Auras. An Aura enters the battlefield attached to a permanent and affects that
permanent while it’s on the battlefield. If the enchanted permanent leaves the battlefield, the Aura is put
into its owner’s graveyard.
Artifact
An artifact represents a magical relic. Like an enchantment, an artifact is a permanent, so it’ll stay on the
battlefield affecting the game. Most artifacts are colorless, so you can cast one no matter what kinds of lands
you have.
Some artifacts are Equipment. You can pay to attach an Equipment to a creature you control to make that
creature more powerful. If an equipped creature leaves the battlefield, the Equipment doesn’t—the creature
drops it and it remains on the battlefield.
Creature
Creatures fight for you. They’re permanents, but unlike any other kind of permanent, creatures can attack
and block. Each creature has power and toughness. Its power (the first number) is how much damage it deals
in combat. Its toughness (the second number) is how much damage must be dealt to it in a single turn to
destroy it. Creatures attack and block during the combat phase.
Unlike other types of permanents, creatures enter the battlefield with “summoning sickness”: a creature
can’t attack, or use an ability that has oT in its cost, until it has started your turn on the battlefield under
your control. You can block with a creature or activate its other abilities no matter how long it’s been on
the battlefield.
Artifact creatures are both artifacts and creatures. They’re usually colorless like other artifacts, and they
can attack and block like other creatures. An artifact creature can be affected by anything that affects
artifacts, as well as anything that affects creatures.

Planeswalker
Planeswalkers are powerful allies you can call on to fight by your side. You can cast a planeswalker only at the
time you could cast a sorcery. They’re permanents, and each one enters the battlefield with the number of
loyalty counters indicated in its lower right corner.
Each planeswalker has loyalty abilities that are activated by adding or removing loyalty counters from the
planeswalker. For example, the symbol ! means “Put one loyalty counter on this planeswalker” and the symbol
3 means “Remove three loyalty counters from this planeswalker.” You can activate one of these abilities only

your opponents can damage them with their spells and abilities instead of damaging you. Any damage dealt
P3-Planeswalker 0172_MTGM14 to a planeswalker causes it to lose that many loyalty counters. If a planeswalker has no loyalty counters, it’s
put into your graveyard.
Land
Although lands are permanents, they aren’t cast as spells. To play a land, just put it onto the battlefield. This
happens immediately, so no player can do anything else in response. You can play a land only during one
of your main phases while the stack is empty. You can’t play more than one land a turn.
Most lands have abilities that make mana. You’ll use lands to make the mana you need to pay for spells
and abilities.
Each basic land has a mana ability that makes one mana of a particular color. Plains make white mana
(oW), Islands make blue mana (oU), Swamps make black mana (oB), Mountains make red mana (oR), and
Forests make green mana (oG). Any land other than these five is a nonbasic land.

16 life left The Stack
Spells and abilities exist on the stack. They wait there to resolve until both
players choose not to cast any new spells or activate any new abilities. Then the last spell or ability that was put onto the stack resolves, and players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities again. (You’ll learn more about casting spells and activating abilities in the next section.) This zone is shared by both players. Library Graveyard Battlefield
You start the game with nothing on the battlefield, but this is where the action

Creatures, artifacts, enchantments, and planeswalkers also enter the battlefield after they resolve. You can arrange your permanents however you want (we recommend putting lands closest to you), but your opponent must be able to see
all of them and tell whether they’re tapped. This zone is shared by both players.

Your graveyard is your discard pile. Your instant and sorcery spells go to your graveyard when they resolve. Your cards go to your graveyard if an effect causes them to be discarded, destroyed, sacrificed, or countered. Your planeswalkers go Library Graveyard

Hand Exile
If a spell or ability exiles a card, that card is put in a game area that’s set apart
from the rest of the game. The card will remain there forever, unless whatever
put it there is able to bring it back. Exiled cards are normally face up. This zone
is shared by both players.

Section 2:
The Building Blocks
This section describes the actions that you’ll take during a game. You’ll learn how to make mana, which is the resource you need to cast spells.
You’ll learn how to cast a spell, as well as how to use abilities. You’ll also learn how to attack and block with your creatures. The section finishes
with a brief description of how to build your first deck and an explanation of the game’s “Golden Rule.”
Making Mana
To do just about anything else in the game, you first need to be
able to make mana. Think of mana as Magic money—it’s what
you use to pay most costs. Each mana is either one of the five
Magic colors or is colorless. When a cost requires colored mana, you’ll see colored mana symbols (Wo for white, Uo for blue, Bo for black, Ro for red, Go for green). When any kind of mana
can be used to pay the cost, you’ll see a symbol with a number
in it (like 2o ).
Where does mana come from? Nearly every land in the game
has an ability that produces mana. Basic lands just have a large Basic land type Can be tapped for
mana symbol in their text boxes to show this—you can tap one
of them to add one mana of that color to your mana pool. (Your
mana pool is where mana is stored until you spend it.) Other Plains oW (white)
lands, as well as some creatures, artifacts, and spells, may also
make mana. They’ll say something like “Add Go to your mana Island oU (blue)
pool.”
Swamp oB (black)
Mana that you’ve made doesn’t last forever. At the end of each
step or phase of the turn, any unused mana in your mana pool Mountain oR (red)
disappears. This doesn’t happen often because usually you’ll only
make mana when you need it to cast a spell or activate an ability. Forest oG (green)
Untapped
Tapping
To tap a card is to turn it sideways. You do this when you use a land to make mana,
when you attack with a creature, or when you activate an ability that has the oT
symbol as part of its cost (oT means “tap this permanent”).
When a permanent is tapped, that usually means it’s been used for the turn. You can’t tap it again until it’s been untapped (straightened out). At the beginning of each of your turns, you untap your tapped cards so you can use them again.
Tapped

Section 2: The Building BlocksSpells
Now that you can make mana, you’ll want to use it to cast spells. All cards except lands are cast as spells. You can cast sorceries,
creatures, artifacts, enchantments, and planeswalkers only during one of your main phases when there’s nothing else on the stack.
Instants can be cast at any time.
Casting a Spell Now check what the spell’s cost is. Tap your lands to produce
the mana necessary to pay that cost, and pay it. Once you do that,

Abilities
As you start to accumulate permanents on the battlefield, the game will change. That’s because many
permanents have text on them that affects the game. This text tells you a permanent’s abilities. There
are three different kinds of abilities a permanent can have: static abilities, triggered abilities, and activated
abilities.
Static Abilities
A static ability is text that is always true while that card is on the battlefield. For example, Imposing
Sovereign is a creature with the ability “Creatures your opponents control enter the battlefield tapped.”
You don’t activate a static ability. It just does what it says.
Triggered Abilities
A triggered ability is text that happens when a specific event occurs in the game. For example, Messenger
Drake is a creature with the ability “When Messenger Drake dies, draw a card.”
Each triggered ability starts with the word “when,” “whenever,” or “at.” You don’t activate a triggered
ability. It automatically triggers whenever the first part of the ability happens. The ability goes on the
stack just like a spell, and resolves just like a spell. If the ability triggers but then the permanent the
ability came from leaves the battlefield, the ability will still resolve.
You can’t choose to delay or ignore a triggered ability. However, if the ability targets something or
someone but you can’t choose a legal target for it, the ability won’t do anything.
Activated Abilities
An activated ability is an ability that you can activate whenever you want, as long as you can pay the
cost. For example, Blood Bairn is a creature with the ability “Sacrifice another creature: Blood Bairn
gets +2/+2 until end of turn.”
Each activated ability has a cost, then a colon (“:”), then an effect. Activating one works exactly like
casting an instant spell, except there’s no card to put on the stack. The ability goes on the stack just like
a spell, and resolves just like a spell. If you activate an ability but then the permanent the ability came
from leaves the battlefield, the ability will still resolve.
Some activated abilities contain the oT symbol in their costs. This means that you must tap the
permanent to activate the ability. You can’t activate the ability if the permanent is already tapped.
S-Spell 0087_MTGM14
Keywords
Some permanents have abilities that are shortened to a single word or phrase. Many of these have
reminder text that gives you a brief description of the ability’s effect. Keyword abilities in the core set
include deathtouch, defender, enchant, equip, first strike, flash, flying, haste, hexproof, indestructible,
landwalk (such as swampwalk or forestwalk), lifelink, protection, reach, trample, and vigilance. Most
of these are static abilities, but keyword abilities can also be triggered abilities or activated abilities.
Detailed explanations of each of these abilities can be found in the glossary at the end of this rulebook.

not any of his or her creatures. You tap the attacking creatures.
They all attack at the same time, even if they’re attacking
different things. You can attack with a creature only if it’s
untapped, and only if it was on the battlefield under your
control when the turn began.
Your opponent chooses which of his or her creatures will
block. Tapped creatures can’t be declared as blockers. For
blocking, it doesn’t matter how long the creature has been on
the battlefield. Each creature can block only one attacker,
but multiple blockers can gang up on a single attacking
creature. If that happens, the attacking player orders
the blockers to show which is first in line for
damage, which is second, and so on. Creatures
don’t have to block.
After all blockers are chosen, combat damage
is assigned. Each creature—both attackers and
blockers—deals damage equal to its power.
• A n attacking creature that isn’t blocked
deals damage to the player or planeswalker it’s
attacking.
• A n attacking creature that is blocked deals damage to
the blocking creatures. If one of your attacking creatures
is blocked by multiple creatures, you decide how to divide
its combat damage among them. You must assign at least
enough damage to the first blocking creature in line to
destroy it before you can assign damage to the next one
in line, and so on.
• A blocking creature deals damage to the attacker it’s
blocking.

Example of Combat
Declare Attackers
The attacking player attacks with his three biggest creatures
and taps them. He doesn’t attack with the smallest because
it’s too easy to destroy, and it might be useful for blocking
on the opponent’s next turn.
Assign Blockers
The defending player assigns blockers to two of the
attackers and lets the third attacker through. Blocking choices are up to the defender.

Section 2: The Building BlocksBuilding Your Own Deck
You play a Magic game with your own customized deck. You build it yourself using whichever Magic cards you want. There are two rules:
your deck must have at least 60 cards, and your deck can’t have more than four copies of any single card (except for basic lands). The rest
is up to you, but here are some guidelines:
Lands. A good rule of thumb is that 40% of your deck should be lands. A 60-card deck usually has about 24 lands.
Creatures. Creatures account for 15 to 25 cards in a typical 60-card deck. Choose creatures that have a variety of mana costs.
Low-cost creatures are potent early on, but high-cost creatures can quickly win a game once they enter the battlefield.
Other cards. Artifacts, enchantments, planeswalkers, instants, and sorceries round out your deck.
After you play with your new deck for a while, you can start to customize it. Take out cards you don’t feel are working well and add new
cards you want to try. The best part about trading card games is being able to play with whatever cards you want, so start experimenting!
Once they build up their collections, Magic players often choose to build different decks for different formats. Formats are defined by
what cards can be played in them. The most popular Magic format is called Standard. It uses only the newest sets the game has to offer. The
current block, the block that was released the previous October, and the most recent core set are all legal to play in a Standard deck. Standard
events are available all year, worldwide. When you’re ready to start exploring other Magic formats, go to Wizards.com/MagicFormats for
more information.
The Golden Rule
When a Magic card contradicts
the rulebook, the card wins. For
example, the rules say creatures
enter the battlefield untapped. But
Imposing Sovereign is a creature
that says “Creatures your opponents
control enter the battlefield tapped.”
Imposing Sovereign changes the
rules as long as it’s on the battlefield.
One of the things that makes the
Magic game fun to play is that there
are individual cards that let you break
almost every rule.

Section 2: The Building BlocksSection 3:
Playing a Game
Now that you know the elements of the game and how to perform the main actions, it’s time to walk through a turn. This section
describes what happens in each part of a turn. In a typical game, you’ll skip many of these parts (for example, nothing usually
happens in the “beginning of combat” step). An actual Magic game is pretty casual, despite how complex the structure may seem.
Get a Deck
You’ll need your own Magic deck. You’ll also need a way to keep track of both players’ life totals, as well as small items to
use as counters or tokens.
When you’re first getting started, you may want to pick up a ready-to-play deck, such as an intro pack or event deck, or
borrow a deck from a friend. After you’ve built up your collection, try building your own deck using the guidelines on page 15.
Get a Friend
To play a game, you’ll need an opponent! Your opponent will play against you using his or her own deck.
Start the Game
Each player starts at 20 life. You win the game
by reducing your opponent to 0 life. You also
win if your opponent has to draw a card when
none are left in his or her deck, or if a spell or
ability says that you win.
Decide which player will go first. If you’ve
just played the same opponent, the loser of the
last game decides who goes first. Otherwise, roll
a die or flip a coin to see who gets to decide.
Each player shuffles his or her deck, then
draws a hand of seven cards to start. If you
don’t like your opening hand, you can mulligan.
Shuffle your hand back into your deck and draw
a new hand of six cards. You can keep doing
this, drawing a hand of one fewer card each
time, until you decide to keep your cards.
Illus. D. Alexander Gregory 16
Section 3: Playing a GameParts of the Turn
Below are the parts of a turn. Each turn proceeds in the same sequence. Whenever you enter a new step or phase, any triggered abilities
that happen during that step or phase trigger and are put on the stack. The active player (the player whose turn it is) gets to cast spells and
activate abilities, then the other player does. When both players in a row decline to do anything and nothing is waiting to resolve, the game
will move to the next step or phase.
With each part of the turn is a description of what can happen during that part, if it’s your turn.

creatures block a single attacker, you order the blockers to show

Section 3: Playing a GameThe Next Turn
Now it’s your opponent’s turn. That player untaps his or her permanents and goes from there. After that player is done, it will be your turn
again. Keep going until a player is reduced to 0 life. As soon as a player has 0 life, the game ends immediately and the other player wins!
The Ever-Changing Game
One of the fascinating aspects of the Magic game
is that it changes from turn to turn—and the cards
themselves can actually alter the rules of the game. As
you play, you’ll find nonland cards with abilities that
produce mana, and lands that do other things besides
produce mana. You’ll find creatures with the haste
ability, which allows them to attack right away. You’ll
find creatures with flying and trample, which change
the rules of combat. You’ll find cards with abilities
that work from your graveyard. You’ll find cards
whose abilities work together for an effect that’s much
more powerful than either one could achieve alone
(such as the combo of Tenacious Dead and Gnawing
Zombie). This is a game of discovery, of amazement,
of fighting, and of tricks. This is a game of magic.

Section 3: Playing a GameSection 4:
Different Ways to Play
You know everything you need to play a Magic game. But what kind of game will you play? Appropriately enough for a game with so
many options, there are lots of different ways to play. Everyone can start on equal footing with brand-new cards rather than build decks
in advance from the cards in their collections. You can even play with a bunch of friends, not just one.
Limited Formats
In Limited play, each player builds his or her own deck on the spot out of a number of booster packs. In other words, your deck is made
from a limited card pool. Each deck must contain at least 40 cards (rather than the usual 60 for a Constructed deck). The only cards
you can play with are the ones opened in those packs, plus any number of basic land cards. (A 40-card deck should have about 17 lands
and about 15 creatures.)
Sealed Deck (any number of players)
In this Limited format, you build a deck out of brand-new booster packs. Each player opens six 15-card boosters and builds a 40-card
deck using the cards from his or her packs and any number of basic lands.
Booster Draft (4 to 8 players)
In this Limited format, instead of just opening your cards and building a deck, you and the other players at the table select (draft) the
cards for your decks. Each player at the table starts with three unopened 15-card booster packs.
At the start of a booster draft, each player opens a pack and picks the card he or she wants from it. (You can’t see the cards that the
other players draft.) Then each player passes the rest of the pack to his or her left. You pick up the pack that was passed to you, select a
card, and pass the rest to your left. This process continues until all the cards have been drafted. Next, each player opens a second pack,
but this time, you pass the pack to your right. After all those cards are drafted, you open the third pack and pass to the left again. Use
your picks and any number of basic lands to build your 40-card deck.

Section 4: Different Ways to PlayMultiplayer Variants
You can play a Magic game with more than two players in it. There are dozens of different ways to do so. Some of the most popular are
Two-Headed Giant and Commander, which can be played using only traditional Magic cards from your collection. Other multiplayer
variants use oversized cards or a special die to provide a unique experience for your play group.

artifacts, and other spells, designed to reflect the personality of
that commander and take advantage of his or her strengths. A
Commander game is best enjoyed as a Free-for-All game among
3–6 players, although two-player games are also common.
Find out more about this grassroots, player-built format at
MTGCommander.net.
Tips
In a multiplayer game, the first time a player takes a mulligan, he or she draws a new hand
of seven cards rather than six cards. Subsequent hands decrease by one card as normal.
In a Two-Headed Giant game, the team who plays first skips the draw step of their first
turn. In all other multiplayer games, no player skips the draw step of his or her first turn.
